# Artificial-Neural-Nets
Approval Prediction With Artificial Neural Nets

In this project, we will build and train a simple deep neural network model to predict the likelihood of a liability customer (depositor) buying personal loans based on customer features like age, experience, income, locations, family, education, existing mortgage, and credit card, etc..

 Lenddo is a leading startup that uses advanced machine learning to analyze over 12,000+ features from various sources of data to predict an individual's creditworthiness (e.g.: social media account use, geolocation data, etc.)

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Understand the applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques in the banking industry.
2. Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Neural Networks.
3. Import key Python libraries, dataset, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
4. Perform data visualization using Seaborn.
5. Standardize the data and split them into train and test datasets.   
6. Build a deep learning model using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a back-end.
7. Assess the performance of the model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
